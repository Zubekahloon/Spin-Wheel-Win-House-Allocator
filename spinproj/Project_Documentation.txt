Project Title: House Number Assignment System (Spin Wheel Lottery)

1️⃣ Purpose:
This project is designed to assign house numbers to users fairly using a Spin Wheel System. The system ensures:
✅ A single user can have multiple houses.
❌ A single house cannot be assigned to multiple users.
✅ The assignment is stored in a database and can be retrieved later.


2️⃣ Project Requirements:

Technologies Used:
*Backend: Django (Python)

*Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Canvas for the Spin Wheel)

*Database: SQLite /

*CSV File Handling: Used to load house-user data


3️⃣ Prerequisites:
1. Install Python & Django
2. Install necessary dependencies using:
   i. pip install django

3. Create a Django project & app
4. Set up models and migrate database

4️⃣ How It Works?

Step 1: Load Users & House Numbers (CSV File)

Open prject folder in which manage.py file exit. Then Go to Terminal and run the Comaand (python manage.py load_users)

A CSV file (house_user_list.csv) contains predefined users and their assigned house numbers.

This file is loaded into the database using a Django management command.

A house number is assigned to only one user, but a user can have multiple houses.
 Then Run this command in terminal ( py manage.py runserver) for run the project in django


Step 2: Spin the Wheel
The Spin Wheel UI randomly picks a house number.

It checks the database to verify house availability.

If the house is already assigned, it skips that house and picks another.

If the house is available, it assigns the house to a user.

And remove the house no in the spin wheel and csv file


Step 3: Store & Display Results
The assigned house number and user details are stored in the database.

The result is displayed on the screen with a popup box.

The updated list of available houses is maintained to avoid duplicate assignments.


5️⃣Workflow (Step by Step)
  1. Upload CSV File - email, house_number is loaded into the system.
  2. House Validation  Checks if the house is already assigned.
  3. Spin the Wheel - Randomly selects a house number.
  4. Check Availability -
 ✅ If available, assign it to the user.
 ❌ If not, choose another house.
  5. Save Assignment - Store user-house mapping in the database.
